Custom domains empower you to offer a tailored and branded experience for your users. Available only as an add-on for projects on the pro and enterprise plans, custom domains not only enhance your brand's visibility but also provide a more professional appearance compared to using Nhost's default domain.

You can configure Custom Domains for Auth, Hasura, PostgreSQL, and your own Run services using both the Nhost Dashboard or the Config file.

The following examples assume we are configuring custom domains at `*.nhost.app`.

Follow the instructions in the **Custom Domain** section of your project's settings:

1. Add a CNAME record in your DNS provider for each of the services you want a custom domain for,  and click "Verify". The verification might take a few seconds to succeed.
2. Once the verification succeeds, click "Save" to update your project.

For Hasura, Auth, and PostgreSQL, custom domains are defined in the default `./nhost/config.toml` as follows: 

```
[hasura]

[hasura.resources.networking]
[[hasura.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['hasura.example.com']

[auth]

[auth.resources.networking]
[[auth.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['auth.nhost.app']

[postgres]

[postgres.resources.networking]
[[postgres.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['postgres.nhost.app']
```

For Run services, typically in `nhost-service.toml` specific to the service:

```
name = 'my-service'

[image]
image = 'docker.io/nhost/my-service'

[[ports]]
port = 8080
type= 'http'
publish = true

[[ports.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['my-service.nhost.app']
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
