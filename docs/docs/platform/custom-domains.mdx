Custom domains empower you to offer a tailored and branded experience for your users. Available only as an add-on for projects on the pro and enterprise plans, custom domains not only enhance your brand's visibility but also provide a more professional appearance compared to using Nhost's default domain.

You can configure Custom Domains for Auth, Hasura (Console and GraphQL API), PostgreSQL, and your own Run services.

### Configure a Custom Domain using the Nhost Dashboard

The example assumes we are configuring custom domains at `*.nhost.app`. Follow the instructions in the **Custom Domain** section of your project's settings:

1. Add a CNAME record in your DNS provider for each of the services you want a custom domain for,  and click "Verify". The verification might take a few seconds to succeed.
2. Once the verification succeeds, click "Save" to update your project.

### Configure a Custom Domain using the Config file

For Hasura, Auth, and PostgreSQL, custom domains are defined in the default `./nhost/config.toml` as follows: 

```
[hasura]

[hasura.resources.networking]
[[hasura.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['hasura.example.com']

[auth]

[auth.resources.networking]
[[auth.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['auth.nhost.app']

[postgres]

[postgres.resources.networking]
[[postgres.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['postgres.nhost.app']
```

For Run services, typically in `nhost-service.toml` specific to the service:

```
name = 'my-service'

[image]
image = 'docker.io/nhost/my-service'

[[ports]]
port = 8080
type= 'http'
publish = true

[[ports.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['my-service.nhost.app']
```
