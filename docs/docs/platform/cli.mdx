Nhost CLI, or `nhost`, is a command-line interface that lets you run and manage Nhost apps locally on Mac, Linux and Windows (WSL2).

This means you get a full-featured Nhost app running locally on your machine:

- Postgres Database
- Hasura GraphQL API
- Hasura Console
- Auth
- Storage
- Serverless Functions

This way, you can develop and test local changes before you deploy them live. The CLI automatically tracks:

- Postgres database migrations
- Hasura metadata
- Serverless functions

It's recommended to commit and push changes to GitHub and use the [GitHub integration](/platform/github-integration) for Nhost to automatically deploy those changes live.

## Installation

To download and install Nhost CLI, run the following command:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhost/cli/main/get.sh | bash
```

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (must be running while using the CLI)

:::info

Make sure you have the correct permissions for Docker so you don't have to run Docker with `sudo`. See ["Post-installation steps for Linux"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) from Docker's documentation.

## Get started

Start by authenticating yourself to Nhost Cloud:

```
nhost login
```

Once signed in, you can list all your Nhost apps using:

```
nhost list
```

Let's start by initializing a remote Nhost app locally with the following command:

```
nhost init --remote
```

Pick a Nhost app to use then change the directory once the app initialization is completed:

```
cd my_test_app
```

Then start the Nhost app locally:

```
nhost up
```

Hasura Console starts automatically and your Nhost app is running locally with the backend URL: `http://localhost:1337`.

## Subdomain and Region

Use `localhost:1337` as the `subdomain`, and skip `region` when using the CLI and the [JavaScript SDK](/reference/javascript):

```
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/nhost-js'

const nhost = new NhostClient({
  subdomain: 'localhost:1337',
})
```

## Emails

During local development with the CLI, all transactional emails from Authentication are sent to a local Mailhog instance, instead of to the recipient's email address. You'll see an address where after starting [`nhost up`](/reference/cli/up) where all emails are sent to.

For the example below, all emails are accessable at `http://localhost:8839`.

```bash
$ nhost up
✔ Your app is running at http://localhost:1337 (Ctrl+C to stop)
ℹ Emails will be sent to http://localhost:8839
```
